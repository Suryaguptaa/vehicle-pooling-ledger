## What it does

Residents of a gated society form commute groups. When someone pays for a shared cab, they log the ride, the system splits the fare equally, updates everyone's balance, and tracks who owes whom. At month end, the group settles up offline and resets all balances with one click.

---

## Features

- Register residents with flat numbers and track running balances
- Create ride groups and manage members
- Log rides, auto-splits fare and updates all participant balances
- Dashboard showing top creditor, top debtor, and group overview
- Stats page with spending charts per person and per group
- One-click group settle that resets all balances to zero
- `@Transactional` ensures balance updates never leave the database in a partial state

## Balance Logic

```
Fare: ₹240  |  Participants: 3  |  Paid by: Rahul

perPersonShare = 240 / 3 = ₹80

Every participant  →  balance -= 80
Payer (Rahul)      →  balance += 240

Result:
  Rahul   →  -80 + 240  =  +₹160  (others owe him)
  Priya   →  -80        =  -₹80   (she owes)
  Sneha   →  -80        =  -₹80   (she owes)
```
